This project demonstrates two algorithms, lawnmower and alternate, which are implemeneted with the purpose of sorting an unsorted list of light and dark disks by light to dark. The algorithms take two different approaches and counts their steps.

Lawnmower compares every adjacent disk from left to right, then right to left each round.
Alternate compares every disk from left to right starting at the first disk to the last disk one round, and compares from the second disk to the second to last disk the other round, and switches the starting disk each round.
